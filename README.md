## Overview

This project is a React application that consumes the Rick & Morty API. It was originally built in JavaScript and has been intentionally migrated to TypeScript to explore typed frontend architecture and safer data handling.

The primary focus of this project is learning how to introduce TypeScript incrementally into an existing codebase, validate external API data using Zod, and structure a React application using scalable patterns such as typed custom hooks and clear separation of concerns.

The application is built with React, TypeScript, Zod, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and serves as a technical learning exercise rather than a production application.
